				<p id="main-info">Refined Elegance and Tranquility Define This Unique Napa Valley Estate with Sweeping Lake Hennessey, Vineyard, Valley and Mountain Views. Situated on 41 acres of stunning hillside, this architectural gem is a study in unparalleled beauty. A striking harmony of contemporary design and nature, this property boasts exquisite views, serenity, and privacy, setting the bar for luxury and sophistication in the Napa Valley. The home’s design was inspired by the skillfully renovated Meiji-era homes in Japan’s art islands, where elements such as “shou sugi ban” or charred cedar cladding, combined with large openings to the outdoors, effectively contemporize the dwellings without sacrificing their place in the environment. This extensive renovation was masterfully executed in 2020 by Juancarlos Fernandez of Signum Architecture. A uniform language of cedar, steel and glass across various structures creates a seamless flow of air and light throughout this 7br/8ba property that includes a gracious main house, studio, large guest house, and guest studio. Exuding sophistication and style, European porcelain and maple wood flooring combine with vast wall spaces and distinctive custom crafted millwork to meld gracefully with the home’s signature design. Walls of glass in the main residence flood the home with natural light and open onto covered decks for the quintessential indoor/outdoor living experience. The family, living, dining and great rooms are deftly positioned on the main floor for communal flow and comfort. The chef’s kitchen is an open concept featuring premium appliances including a Wolf 6-burner range, 2 concealed Miele dishwashers, and Sub Zero refrigerator/freezer and under-counter freezer drawers. The upstairs level has three expansive, light-filled bedroom suites with panoramic views of the rugged hills, vineyard-speckled valleys, and Lake Hennessey. A perfect foil to the sun-kissed living quarters is the home theater featuring ample seating, Sony 4K projector and Sonance surround sound for the ultimate movie experience. The ground level features two additional guest bedrooms with a shared bathroom, kitchenette and bar, wine cellar, and a generous living/dining area that opens to the pool terrace. There is also a pool bathroom for convenience.</p>
